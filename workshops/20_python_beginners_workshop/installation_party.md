# Installation Party

We'll ask you to do two installations: 
1. One for Python interpreter so that you can run your code.
2. Second for Pycharm which is a powerful editor (actually it is an [Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) to make your programming efforts easier.
